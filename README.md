Family names in the Netherlands
-------------------------------

This project exists to make structured, machine readable data out of the [Meertens Dutch Family Name Database](http://www.meertens.knaw.nl/nfb/).

We scrape the Meertens website to generate a CSV file (`family_names_in_the_netherlands.csv`[]) that contains: the family name, the number of times it was counted in 2007, and name as lemma (meaning: the 'base' version names that have multiple variants).
